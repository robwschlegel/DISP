## Abstract

Marine heatwaves (MHWs) are prolonged periods in which ocean waters reach very warm temperatures.  These heat events occur in oceans around the world and affect many marine ecosystems.  The Northwest Atlantic Ocean was hit by one of these heat events in 2012.  This event negatively impacted many coastal ecosystems by causing a shift in many marine species’ migratory cycles as well as their geographic distributions.  The American lobster (Homarus americanus) which is the species of interest in this study, was also seen to alter their geographic distribution due to this MHW.  However, studies show that MHWs have some positive effects on the American lobster.  The purpose of this study is to establish a base line for other studies to build on considering that the direct correlation between MHWs and the American lobster has never been explored before.  A programming system was used to carry out this study in which many different statistical calculations were made by using code.  The data used for this study was collected off the coast of Nova Scotia where the areas of interest for this study are the northern and southern coats.  This includes bottom temperature data as well as lobster catch rate data.  Evidence shows that short MHWs are likely to be a positive factor for lobsters in this region. 

## Introduction

  Lobsters are crustaceans that live in all oceans around the world (Goldberg).  These marine animals have an important role in the economy and have been known to be one of the most valuable resources to coastal regions.  In fact, the American lobster is the most profitable fishery in Canada as well as in the United States (Le Bris et al. 2017).  Population sizes in these crustaceans were seen to alter after the Northwest Atlantic Ocean was hit by a MHW in 2012 (Mills et al. 2013).  A MHW occurs when ocean waters reach extremely warm temperatures for an extended amount of time (Oliver et al. 2018).  These heat events are based on their intensity, duration, the rate at which they evolve as well as their spatial extent.  More precisely, a MHW is defined as a heat event lasting five days or more with temperatures being warmer than the 90th percentile based on a 30 year historical baseline period (Hobday et al. 2016). 

  The Northwest Atlantic MHW was the largest heat event to take place in this region in 30 years previous to 2012 (Mills et al. 2013).  The SST was found to be 1-3°C more than the average from the years 1982 to 2011 (Mills et al. 2013).  This heat event affected multiple marine ecosystems, many of which were coastal.  This rise in temperature led to a shift in the geographic distribution as well as migratory cycles of many coastal species.  Marine species that habituated warm waters responded to this MHW by moving northward (Mills et al. 2013).  This MHW showed to also have a migratory effect on the American lobster considering that they had begun to move from offshore areas into coastal areas.  This made lobster fishing much easier since they were in more shallow, closer regions (Mills et al. 2013).  Not only did this rise in heat affect their geographic distribution, but studies show that it also had an effect on lobster larvae by increasing their rate of development (Le Bris et al. 2017).  According to previous studies, the abundance of smaller lobsters seems to also increase in warmer temperatures (Le Bris et al. 2017).   More negatively, the spread of epizootic shell disease in lobsters was seen to be a direct outcome of increasing temperatures (Mills et al. 2013).
  
  The objective of this study is to explore the effects of MHWs on lobsters off the coast of Nova Scotia.  The purpose of this research is to establish a base line for other studies to build on since this is the first time this relationship has ever been explored.  In order to calculate the correlation between MHWs and lobster catch rates, various statistical analyses were performed on a programming system.  MHWs were calculated and afterwards correlated with lobster catch rates as well as our regions of interest in Nova Scotia.
  
## Methods

# Data collection

	The data used in this study was collected in the field by lobstermen from Nova Scotia.  These lobstermen placed temperature recorders inside of lobster traps and subsequently threw the equipped traps overboard.  One week later, the lobstermen went back to the location where they dropped the traps to collect them.  They noted the temperature indicated on the temperature recorders as well as the number of lobsters caught.  Afterwards, this information was sent to the Bedford Institute of Oceanography for processing.  This data was changed into CPUE (catch per unit effort) which is an indirect measure of the abundance of species of interest (Heinänen 2018).  This process was repeated each week from 2006 to 2016. Temperature data was only collected during the summer in the northern coast of Nova Scotia whereas data collection in the South occurred throughout the year excluding summer. 
	
# Analyses

  This study was completed by using a computer program called “R”.  This is a statistical programming language where anything from creating your own graphs and maps to manipulating data can be done.  With R, bias is prevented in the results considering that they can be reproduced.  Data from the northern and southern coasts were used in this research because the months of sampling were different.  The first step in this study was to average the bottom temperature CPUE.  Afterwards, the climatology in both the North and South of Nova Scotia were calculated by correlating the bottom temperature CPUE and the climatology period of our study.  Climatology is defined as the study of weather conditions which are averaged over a certain period of time (National Drought Mitigation Center 2019).   MHWs that occurred in the North and South during the time of the study were then calculated by using a code that detects major heat events from the previously calculated climatology’s.  These calculations were possible due to an R package called HeatWaveR which detects heatwaves as well as cold-spells (Schlegel and Smit 2018).  Once this was finished, many different correlations became available such as the correlation between the bottom temperature CPUE and the duration of the heat wave.  A scatter plot for this relationship was created by using ggplot2 which is a data visualization package available on R (Wickham 2016).  A map of the study area was created with ggplot2 and a lolliplot of the MHWs in the study area was made by using the lolliplot function on R.


## Results

  In order to provide a better visualization of the study area, Figure 1 was created.  The different coloured grid cells around the coast of Nova Scotia represent the different locations in which the lobstermen collected their data.  In blue, the northern coast of Nova Scotia is identified whereas the southern coast is shown in green.  The x-axis of this map is the longitude which measures how far east or west a point is from the meridian.  The y-axis is the latitude which measures how far north or south a point is from the equator (Journey North 2019).  According to this figure, the longitude from the northern to southern coast of Nova Scotia is approximately -57.5 to -66.8 whereas the latitude from the southern to northern coast is around 42.7 to 47.8.

  Figure 2 is a lolliplot showing all MHWs that occurred in the North and South of Nova Scotia during the study period.  The North is represented by the first lolliplot which has nine peak dates.  According to this figure, the northern coast had the most MHWs in 2012 with a number of five peak dates.  The lowest peak date that year is a faded red colour meaning its intensity of around 1.3°C is too low to be classed as a MHW. The highest peak date in the North occurred at the end of that same year with a maximum intensity of around 3.2°C.  The second highest peak that year had a maximum intensity of approximately 2.5°C.  In 2010, another faded red peak date is present.  The second largest MHW that occurred in the North was in 2008 which a maximum intensity of approximately 2.6°C.  Two other peak dates are present in the first lolliplot, one taking place near the end of 2006 and another at the beginning of 2007, the largest one having a maximum intensity of around 2.2°C.  The second lolliplot represents all the MHWs that occurred in the South of Nova Scotia during the study period.  There is a total of 11 peak dates in this figure, most of which taking place in 2012 with a number of 5 peak dates. The highest peak that year has a maximum intensity of around 2.1°C whereas the lowest peak which is a faded red colour has a maximum intensity of approximately 1.1°C.  There is a peak date taking place directly at the beginning of 2013 with a maximum intensity of around 1.4°C.  Other red faded peaks are present in this second lolliplot, one taking place in 2011, another in 2015 and a last one at the beginning of 2016.  The larger out of these faded red peak dates is the one that took place in 2016 with a maximum intensity of around 1.3°C.  There are two other MHWs that occurred in the South, both near the end of 2010.  These peaks are very similar in relation to their maximum intensity’s considering that the first has a maximum intensity of around 1.6°C while that of the following one is approximately 1.5°C.

  Figure 3 is a visual representation of the correlation between the mean CPUE and the duration of the MHWs which occurred in the northern coast of Nova Scotia.  The x-axis is labelled as the mean CPUE which ranges from around 0.45 to 1.6.  The y-axis is the duration of the MHWs that took place which ranges from around three to 27 days.  There is a total of 13 data points on this scatter plot, most of which are under 15 days.  There are nine data points under 15 days and four data points above 15 days.  The four data points above 15 days have different mean CPUE’s, but the same duration of approximately 28 days.  It is shown that the data points under the 15 days duration are more dispersed.  However, there are four data points in this region that have the same duration of about seven days and two other data points in this region that have a duration of approximately 12 days.  The correlation line in blue is shown to decrease as the mean CPUE increases.  The “r” is the coefficient of correlation which is -0.46.

  Figure 4 is a visual representation of the correlation between the mean CPUE and the duration of the MHWs which occurred in the southern coast of Nova Scotia.  The x-axis is labelled as the mean CPUE which ranges from around 0.3 to 1.8.  The y-axis is the duration of the MHWs that took place which ranges from around 9 to 78 days.  There is a total of 17 data points on this scatter plot.  There are nine data points under 40 days and eights data points over 40 days.  The eight data points above the 40 days have slightly different mean CPUE’s, but the same duration of around 78 days.  It is shown that the data points under the 40 days duration are more dispersed.  However, there are three data points in this region that have the same duration of about 29 days and two other data points in this region that have a duration of approximately 18 days. The correlation line in blue is shown to decrease as the mean CPUE increases.  The “r” is the coefficient of correlation which is -0.66.

## Discussion

  As shown in Figure 1, the grid cells in the South are much smaller than those in the North.  This means that the regions of data collection in the northern coast were larger than the regions of data collection in the South.  The areas of data collection in the southern coast are fairly equal in size and shape except for one grid cell which is much larger and triangular.  Contrary, the size of the grid cells vary much more in the northern coast which could be a result of lobstermen collecting data further off the coast in this region.

  According to Figure 2, larger category MHWs seem to have taken place in the northern coast of Nova Scotia between 2006 to 2016.  Evidence of this is that the highest peak in the North is approximately 1.1°C warmer than the highest peak in the South.  Furthermore, the second highest peak in the northern coast is larger than the largest peak in the southern coast differing by around 0.5°C.  There are only two red faded peak dates in the North whereas the South has four of these types of peaks which is further proof of larger category MHWs occurring in the North.  According to this figure, there are more heat events that occurred in the southern coast considering that this region has two peak dates more than the northern coast.  However, this could be a result of more data collection coming from the South.  Both the North and the South have the same amount of more intense heat events with a number of seven bold red peaks each.  Most MHWs seem to have happened in 2012 in both the North and the South of Nova Scotia which is completely practical considering that these coasts are not too far from each other.  The northern coast has five peak dates in 2012 which is more than half of the total peak dates in this region.  The South has 6 peak dates in 2012 which is also more than half of the total peak dates in this area.  According to this figure, no MHWs occurred after 2012 in the northern coast whereas the southern coast shows to have three other peak dates after this same year.  Moreover, MHWs seem to occur earlier in the North since they begin in 2006 whereas the MHWs in the South begin to occur near the end of 2010.  In general, the MHWs in the northern coast begin and end earlier and the MHWs in the southern coast begin and end later which is a potential result of having different sampling months.
  
  According to Figure 3, it seems as though MHWs are bad for lobsters since the coefficient of correlation is -0.46 while a good result would have to be a coefficient of correlation above 5.  This is evidence of MHWs not being good for lobsters.  This result contradicts the findings of another study showing that the increase in SST near Halifax lead to an increase in lobster juvenile growth rates in 1980 (Campbell et al. 1991).  However, most of the data points are under 15 days which means that most lobsters were caught when the MHWs were shorter.  It seems as though MHWs that last around seven days are better for the American lobster considering that four data points are found at this exact time.  Furthermore, it seems as though the maximum duration of MHWs that lobsters in the North can handle is around 12 days considering that there is a large gap with no data points up until around 28 days is reached.  This gap of data points could be a result of a lobster die off due to prolonged water temperatures.  This die off can be explained by a study showing that warmer waters cause epizootic shell diseases in lobsters (Le Bris et al. 2018).  The four data points above 15 days are placed at approximately 28 days which contradicts previous evidence showing that shorter MHWs are better for lobsters in the North.  These data points could be random luck, but this may not be the case leading to the assumption that MHWs of around 28 days are also good for lobsters.
  
  According to Figure 4, it seems as though longer heat waves are also bad for lobsters in the southern coast considering that there are less data points above 40 days.  This could mean that lobsters in this region also prefer warmer waters, but only for a short period of time.  This result can be supported by the findings of a study conducted in 2019 which found that lobster larvae develop at a faster rate in warmer waters (Harrington et al. 2019).  This would explain why lobster catch rates increased as the ocean water warmed in the South.  However, once 29 days is surpassed, lobsters are shown to be less present because there is a large gap in which no data points are present up until 78 days is reached.  Once this amount of time is reached, there are eight data points all placed at the same duration.  This behaviour is similar to that of the North coast which provides further evidence that a certain prolonged length of MHWs can be good for the American lobster.  Another similarity between the North and the South is that both scatter plots have nine data points in the low duration period.  Contrary to the North, the South has a lower coefficient of correlation of -0.66 meaning that the correlation between the mean CPUE and the duration is even worse than that of the North.  The southern coast has four more data points than the North and this is most likely due to data collection which happened all throughout the year excluding the summer in this region whereas the data collection in the North was only collected during the summer.    
  
## Conclusion

  Overall, the correlation between MHWs and lobster catch rates off the coast of Nova Scotia is negative.  This correlation shows that MHWs are bad for lobsters in the study area, yet it seems as though short MHWs can be good for this species.  Since this study used 10 year’ worth of lobster and temperature data, this conclusion cannot be definite considering that 30 year’ worth of data is needed to do this.  However, this conclusion can provide helpful information which could benefit lobster fisheries in Nova Scotia.
